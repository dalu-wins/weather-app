# Weather

A simple weather app project coded with flutter.

## Getting Started

To use the app you have to go to OpenWeatherMap and create an account. It will automatically provide you with an API key.
Then insert the key in the empty Sting field in lib/data/api_key_secret.dart.
If you have done that, you are ready to go!

## Supported Devices

Only tested on Android. If you want to use the app on another platform you might have to include the required permission configurations yourself.
