# Weather

A simple weather app coded with flutter.

## Getting Started

First create an [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) account. Here is why:
- It will automatically provide you with your own API key which you can then find [here](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys)
- Insert the key in the empty string field in [lib/data/api_key_secret.dart](lib/data/api_key_secret.dart)
- Now you are ready to build and run the project!

```
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## Supported Devices

Only tested on Android. If you want to use the app on another platform you might have to implement the required location permission yourself.
